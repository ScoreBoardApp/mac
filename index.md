layout: home
---

A fully functional utility for displaying statistics in a sports stream via OBS, Wirecast, Streamlabs, etc. It will help display the statistics needed for a specific game over your video of online sports broadcasts.

Text data is written to TXT files on your computer's disk (by default, to the Downloads directory). Each file can be used in a streamer program (add source: text) and overlaid on any image of your scoreboard.
