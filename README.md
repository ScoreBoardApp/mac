# ScoreBoard for sport stream
**A simple statistics utility for streaming live sports games in OBS or Wirecast on MacOS.**

## Info
Scoreboard to improve your sports streams on OBS, Wirecast, Streamlabs and more. It will help you easily display statistics over the online broadcast of sports games.

Statistics are written to TXT files on the computer disk (by default, to the Downloads directory). Each file can be used in a streamer program (add source: text) and overlay it over any of your scoreboard images.

### ScoreBoard allows you to keep statistics:
- Time (timer or stopwatch)
- Goals (points, strikes) for each team
- Period (half, quarter)
- The names of the two teams
- Penalties for hockey and similar games
